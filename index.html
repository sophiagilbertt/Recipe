  <ol>
        <li> At least 8 hours or the night before you make the soup, place the beans in a large bowl and add enough cold water to cover the beans by 2 inches. Refrigerate for at least 8 hours or overnight.  Drain the beans, rinse under cold running water, and drain again.  Set aside. </li>
        <li> In a large (10-inch) pot or Dutch oven such as Le Creuset, heat ¼ cup of olive oil over medium heat, add the pancetta, and sauté for 4 to 5 minutes, until browned.</li>
        <li>Add the leeks, onions, carrots, celery, garlic, and rosemary and cook over medium-low for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender.</li>
        <li>Add the beans, 8 cups of the chicken stock, bay leaves, 1 tablespoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Lower the heat and simmer, partially covered, for 1 hour and 30 minutes, until the beans are tender.</li>
        <li>Stir occasionally, scraping the bottom of the pot.</li>
        <li>Discard the bay leaves, cover the pot, and allow the soup to sit off the heat for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add up to 2 more cups of chicken stock if the soup is too thick.</li>
